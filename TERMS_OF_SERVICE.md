# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: December 26, 2025**

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using SwipeCardz ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

## 2. Description of Service

SwipeCardz is a flashcard application that allows users to create, import, and study flashcard decks. The App offers both free and paid features.

## 3. User Accounts

SwipeCardz does not require account registration. All user data is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and any data stored within the App.

## 4. In-App Purchases

### 4.1 Lifetime Unlimited Access
SwipeCardz offers a one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase ("Lifetime Unlimited") that grants permanent access to core premium features, including unlimited deck creation.

### 4.2 AI-Powered Features
SwipeCardz may offer AI-powered features ("AI Features") that are separate from the Lifetime Unlimited purchase. AI Features may be offered as:
- Separate one-time purchases
- Subscription-based access
- Usage-based pricing (e.g., credits or tokens)

The Lifetime Unlimited purchase does not include access to AI Features unless explicitly stated. AI Features have ongoing operational costs and are therefore priced separately from the core app functionality.

### 4.3 Pricing
Prices are displayed in your local currency within the App. All prices are subject to change without notice.

### 4.4 Payment Processing
All payments are processed through Apple's App Store. By making a purchase, you also agree to Apple's terms and conditions.

### 4.5 Refunds
Refund requests must be directed to Apple through the App Store, as Apple handles all payment processing. We do not have the ability to process refunds directly.

### 4.6 No Subscription for Core Features
The Lifetime Unlimited purchase is a one-time payment with no recurring charges. Note that AI Features, if offered, may have their own separate pricing structure including subscriptions.

## 5. User Content

### 5.1 Your Content
You retain all rights to the flashcard content you create or import into the App. SwipeCardz does not claim ownership of your content.

### 5.2 Local Storage
All flashcard data is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to, collect, or store your flashcard content on our servers.

### 5.3 Data Loss
You are responsible for backing up your device. We are not liable for any loss of data due to device failure, app deletion, or other circumstances.

## 6. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:
- Use the App for any unlawful purpose
- Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App
- Remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels on the App
- Use the App to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others

## 7. Intellectual Property

The App, including its design, features, and original content (excluding user-generated content), is owned by SwipeCardz and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

## 8. Third-Party Services

### 8.1 Google Sheets Integration
The App allows importing flashcards from Google Sheets. Your use of Google Sheets is subject to Google's terms of service. We are not responsible for the availability or functionality of Google Sheets.

### 8.2 App Store
The App is distributed through Apple's App Store. Your use of the App Store is subject to Apple's terms and conditions.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

We do not warrant that:
- The App will meet your specific requirements
- The App will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free
- Any errors in the App will be corrected

## 10. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SWIPECARDZ SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES RESULTING FROM:

- Your use or inability to use the App
- Any unauthorized access to or use of your device
- Any bugs, viruses, or other harmful code transmitted through the App
- Any errors or omissions in any content

## 11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless SwipeCardz and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of your use of the App or violation of these Terms.

## 12. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.

## 13. Termination

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without prior notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties.

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 15. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

## 16. Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and SwipeCardz regarding the use of the App, superseding any prior agreements.
